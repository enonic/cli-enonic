== Upgrade notes

* In CLI 3.x, the `sandbox start` command will start the sandbox in dev mode by default. If you want to start the sandbox in prod mode, provide the `--prod` option.
* All the commands that may potentially create a new sandbox (f.ex. `sandbox create` or `project create`) will now suggest starting the new sandbox after it's created. If such a command is used in combination with `-f` (`--force`) option, the sandbox will be started without prompt. This may potentially affect some scripts if the command is followed by another command which now won't be reached because script execution will be taken over by the running sandbox.
