|`-a, --auth`
|A token for basic authentication in the following format <user:password>. Starting from XP 7.15, the `--auth` flag is *deprecated*. Use service account keys with `--cred-file` flag instead

|`--cred-file`
|Path to a service account key file (in JSON format). This flag will only work with XP 7.15 or later. A key file can be generated in the Users application for System ID Provider users (aka Service Accounts). If specified, the `--auth` (or `-a`) flag will be ignored.

|`--client-key`
|Client key, required only for mTLS session.

|`--client-cert`
|Client certificate, required only for mTLS session.

[NOTE]
====
* if the `auth` param is missing and there is no valid session, CLI will look for `ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_USER` and `ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_PASS` environment variables. See <<environment_variables, configuration section.>>

* if the `cred-file` param is missing, CLI will look for the `ENONIC_CLI_CRED_FILE` environment variable. If this environment variable is also missing, then CLI will fall back to the `auth` param. See <<environment_variables, configuration section.>>
